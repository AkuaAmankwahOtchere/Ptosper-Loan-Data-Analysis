# Prosper-Loan-Data-Analysis
This project is an analysis of the Prosper loans dataset. Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending platform that connects borrowers with investors who are willing to fund their loans. The Prosper loans dataset contains information on over 100,000 loans originated on the platform, including the loan amount, interest rate, borrower income, and other relevant variables.

The project begins by exploring the structure of the Prosper loans dataset and identifying the key variables and their definitions. It then moves on to conduct a thorough exploratory analysis of the data, using a variety of visualizations and summary statistics to understand the distribution and relationships among the variables.

Next, the project applies machine learning techniques to build predictive models that can be used to forecast the likelihood of loan defaults. The project compares the performance of different models and evaluates their accuracy and reliability.

The final section of the project presents the findings and insights from the analysis of the Prosper loans dataset. The project concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings and suggestions for future research in the field of peer-to-peer lending.

Overall, this project is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about the Prosper loans dataset and the insights that can be gained from analyzing it.
